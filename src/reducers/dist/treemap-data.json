        "article": "SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A debate over gay marriage has upturned Costa Rica\u2019s presidential race, giving ammunition to conservative frontrunners ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote and challenging the Central American country\u2019s image as a progressive bastion.  Evangelical Christian singer and congressman Fabricio Alvarado, who leads recent polls, has pitted himself against a January ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that urges Costa Rica to legalize same-sex marriage. Alvarado, 43, has said the Costa Rica-based court is violating the country\u2019s sovereignty and jeopardizing its \u201ctraditional family\u201d values. He has threatened to withdraw Costa Rica from the court system, as Venezuela did.   \u201cWe are not ready for a LGBT agenda,\u201d Alvarado said at a candidate debate. \u201cLet\u2019s make February 4 our referendum on the marriage between men and women.\u201d  His meteoric rise is unlikely to be enough for him to win without a run-off vote in April. But Alvarado has pushed other candidates among the 13 contenders to adopt more conservative tones, including ex-government minister Antonio Alvarez Desanti, leader of the powerful National Liberation party. Alvarez Desanti, a 59-year-old banana entrepreneur, has pledged to respect the court\u2019s decision on gay marriage but said he would not personally support it. That sparked criticism from liberal factions of his center-right party in a country whose \u201cpura vida,\u201d catchphrase suggests a chilled approach to life. Neither Alvarado nor Alvarez Desanti is expected to reach the 40 percent of votes required to win in the first round. Conservative Juan Diego Castro also hopes to land on the April run-off ballot. The former justice minister is running on a platform of tough anti-crime measures and less restrictions on miners and oil companies in a nation known for stewardship of rainforests and oceans.  \u201cFEAR OF GOD\u201d Out of three candidates who support same-sex marriage, the most likely to reach a second round is Carlos Alvarado, a former labor minister and an ally of President Luis Guillermo Solis.  Solis is barred by law from seeking a second consecutive term. Despite Costa Rica\u2019s reputation as socially forward looking, with high education and health standards, reproductive rights such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and abortion are not widely accepted, and seven out of ten people consider themselves conservative, according to a University of Costa Rica poll.    \u201cThose who propose gay marriage do not understand Costa Rica,\u201d said Marcela Linares, 56, as she attended to her stall in a San Jose marketplace presided over by an image of Costa Rica\u2019s patron saint. \u201cThis country is not that, here it is marriage between a man and a woman. Here there is fear of God.\u201d  The gay community has counted some triumphs, however.  Solis\u2019 administration and his Citizen Action Party (PAC) flew a rainbow-striped flag over the presidential house in 2014, the first time a Latin American government raised the gay rights banner over an official building.  A request from Solis several years ago prompted the Inter-American Court\u2019s ruling on legalizing gay marriage. \u201cThere is a hypocritical and electoral use of the resolution of the Inter-American Court. But it works in our favor - those who don\u2019t believe in equality will be divided,\u201d said Marco Castillo, an attorney and leader of the Diversity Movement advocacy group.  Many of Costa Rica\u2019s 3.3 million voters are still unsure who to support, according to polls, after a campaign season marked by skepticism and apathy.  \u201cI\u2018m going to go vote, but I don\u2019t yet know for who,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Esteban Ram\u00edrez, a 35-year-old dentist. \u201cBefore, I chose the least-worst, but now it is difficult to know who is the worst.\u201d Reporting by Enrique Andres Pretel; Writing by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Andrew HayOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "article": "(Reuters) - HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N), the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, helped by strong patient volumes. Shares of the company rose more than 9 percent to a record of $106.84. That was in sharp contrast to the broader healthcare sector .SPXHC, which fell after Amazon AMZN.N, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) said they would form a healthcare company. Hospital operators have been plagued by weak patient admissions in the past few quarters, but HCA has been buying hospitals from rivals in the face of the decline.  HCA, which last year made deals with Community Health Systems (CYH.N) and Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) to buy hospitals and medical centers, said on Tuesday it would continue its acquisition spree. \u201cWith respect to the pipeline, we continue to have a lot of potential transactions that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Chief Executive R Milton Johnson said on a post-earnings call with analysts. HCA said same-facility equivalent admissions, which include patients who stay in the hospital overnight and those who are treated on an outpatient basis, rose 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cHCA put up a very strong print amid the Amazon noise dominating healthcare this morning,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said. The company, the first among hospital operators to report fourth-quarter results, said it saw \u201cmodest\u201d elements of flu activity in the quarter. Flu continues to be widespread across the United States and the season is on track to be one of the most severe since 2014/2015. HCA, which also initiated a quarterly dividend, said it would invest $10.5 billion over the next three years, higher than its pervious target of $8.2 billion. The announcement on dividend and budget shows HCA\u2019s confidence in its long-term financial strength, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matthew Borsch said. Net income attributable to HCA plunged 48.5 percent to $474 million, or $1.30 per share, as it booked a $301 million charge related to the recently passed U.S. tax reform.     Excluding items, the company earned $2.13 per share on revenue of $11.56 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.87 for earnings and $11.17 billion for revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

        "article": " (This version of the Jan. 24 story corrects the number of Baxter plants in Puerto Rico making small IV bags to two from three in paragraph five) By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO (Reuters) - Baxter International informed customers on Wednesday that it has been given approval by U.S. regulators to import large saline bags from its plant in Mexico in an effort to ease hospital shortages of the product as the nation faces a severe flu season. Supply issues related to Baxter\u2019s small-volume saline bags - which are produced in the U.S. market in Puerto Rico - have begun to ease as production there improves, Scott Luce, general manager of Baxter\u2019s U.S. Hospital products division, wrote in a letter addressed to customers and seen by Reuters. Drugmakers including Baxter have been scrambling to meet demand for essential hospital products including IV saline and smaller IV bags, which have been disrupted by prolonged power outages in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria pummeled the Caribbean island on Sept. 20. \u201cOverall, we are making progress on product supply,\u201d  Luce wrote. Both of Baxter\u2019s two plants in Puerto Rico that make small IV bags - used to mix and deliver a host of medicines to hospital patients - are now connected to the commercial electric grid, the company said. The company has maintained diesel generators to handle intermittent power outages and has installed backup satellite communications to support plant operations. Baxter only makes the smaller volume IV products in Puerto Rico; it manufactures larger IV bags elsewhere in the United States. Shortages of the smaller bags in the wake of the hurricane caused many hospital pharmacists to turn to larger IV bags to deliver medications. Now, with the United States in the throes of one of the worst flu seasons in several years, demand for the larger volume bags - used to hydrate flu patients - has increased dramatically. \u201cWe\u2019ve been producing as much as we can, but we\u2019re not the only one in the market,\u201d said Baxter spokesman William Rader. The market for the larger bags had been constrained even before the hurricane. In August, B. Braun Medical warned customers that production interruptions had caused decreases in supply of the company\u2019s small- and large-volume products.  In a statement issued earlier this month, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency had given B. Braun and Baxter temporary approval to import products from some of their overseas operations, including allowing Baxter to import product from Brazil. At that time, Gottlieb said he believed the IV fluid shortage would improve shortly. The FDA has also been working with companies to extend expiration dates on products, when it can be done safely. It recently approved two additional companies - Fresenius Kabi, a unit of Germany\u2019s Fresenius, and Spain\u2019s Laboratorios Grifols - to supply saline to the U.S. market. In its letter to customers, Baxter said the FDA has now granted it permanent approval to bring larger IV bags manufactured in Mexico into the U.S. market. \u201cThe news is very good,\u201d said Christi Guess, senior director of contract services for Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals. She said with the addition of the products from the Mexico plant, Baxter is now up to 100 percent allocation for most saline products, which means clients can order 100 percent of what they have historically ordered in the past, but no more. Erin Fox, who tracks nationwide drug shortages and heads the University of Utah health system\u2019s drug information and support services, said saline supply issues remain.  \u201cWe\u2019re not even close to getting what we used to,\u201d she said. Hospital pharmacists have turned to a number of workarounds to address the shortages. For example, hospitals have used syringes to deliver some medications but that has resulted in shortages of syringes, Fox said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a house of cards,\u201d Fox said. \u201cEach solution you come up with has resulted in some kind of a roadblock.\u201d  Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Leslie Adler and Frances KerryOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

        "article": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As champagne and caviar wash down tough talk of world problems in Davos, the stench of rotten rubbish lingers over an alternative summit in Kenya aimed at tackling the chasm between rich and poor. Welcome to the Kenyan slum of Dandora: known for its fetid garbage mountain and - for this week only - playing host to campaigners who are fed up with top-table talk and say they see scant action at ground level where it matters most. The annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in the plush Swiss ski resort of Davos brings together politicians and billionaires, corporates and celebrities for four days of summitry on the world\u2019s most pressing issues - issues such as global inequality. But despite celebrating its 48th annual meeting, the WEF has failed to curb the rising wealth gap, say activists, who are instead lobbying for change at their own rival events this week. \u201cThe WEF has continued to list inequality as one of the world\u2019s major challenges, and the WEF itself says it isn\u2019t getting any better. But also they have an interest in not fixing it,\u201d said Ben Phillips, director of Global Inequality Alliance, a coalition of 150 charities and trade unions in 50 countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to go to a fancy gathering, and over caviar and champagne talk about why every child should go to school and why every mother deserves good health care. But those same bosses who lobby for corporate tax breaks are taking away money from countries that would go into health and education.\u201d Eighty-two percent of wealth generated last year went to the richest 1 percent of the global population, while the 3.7 billion people - who make up the poorest half of the world - saw no increase in their wealth, says the charity Oxfam.  Billionaire wealth has risen by an annual average of 13 percent since 2010 \u2013 six times faster than the wages of ordinary workers, which has risen by a yearly average of 2.0 percent over the same period, according to an Oxfam report on Monday. A TALE OF TWO MOUNTAINS Phillips said communities in countries such as Kenya, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Mexico feel inequality will not be solved by the \u2018Davos man\u2019, but by ordinary people mobilizing for their rights. So events - ranging from concerts to soccer matches, mass meals to marches - are taking place to help some of the world\u2019s most marginalized understand their rights and demand action. Located on the outskirts of eastern Nairobi, Dandora slum is a stark example of the inequalities faced by millions worldwide. Established in 1977 and partially funded by the World Bank, with the aim of offering a higher standard of housing, the area has become the Kenyan capital\u2019s principal dumping ground. The sprawling rubbish tip - which residents estimate is at least the size of three football fields - is a vast mountain, composed of everything from polythene bags and plastic bottles to soiled clothes, rotting food and animal faeces. It is also one of the area\u2019s key employers.  For many of Dandora\u2019s thousands of residents eke out a living on the tip, collecting recyclable waste such as plastic bottles for a daily wage of about 200 Kenyan Shillings ($2). Amid the stench, 59-year-old Marita Saie squats by a dirty puddle, diligently washing a pile of polystyrene plates. \u201cI manage to make 100 to 150 shillings in a day collecting things from the rubbish,\u201d said Saie, who is the sole provider for her two grandchildren. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to cover everything like rent and food. Even when I am sick, I can\u2019t afford to buy medicines, so I look for them in rubbish. I can\u2019t change this life, it\u2019s up to God.\u201d TAX THE RICH Campaigners say despite Kenya\u2019s stable economic growth averaging about 5.6 percent of GDP over the last decade, the disparity between rich and poor is on the rise. The number of super-rich in Kenya is among the fastest growing in the world, and Oxfam predicts the number of millionaires in Kenya will grow by 80 percent over next decade. Yet while a minority of Kenyans are accumulating wealth, the benefits of economic growth have not trickled down. The United Nations says four in 10 Kenyans are poor, 13 percent are \u201cdestitute\u201d.  But such inequality is not inevitable, say campaigners.  Higher spending on education and health would help close the gap, they say - and having a fair tax system is key. Kenya relies on tax as its main source of domestic revenue, but contributions by the rich are negligible, said Oxfam. Capital gains tax, for example, is 5 percent and there is no inheritance tax or net wealth tax. Higher taxes could let the government invest more in sectors such as health, education and job creation, activists say.  And grassroots movements - where ordinary people understand the issues and can organize and lobby to change government policies - are the best way to achieve this, they say. RAP FOR CHANGE So campaigners in Nairobi are organizing the Usawa Festival, or Equality Festival, in Dandora on Saturday, with music and dance deployed to highlight social problems and engage people. Juliani, a popular Kenyan hip-hop gospel musician - who raps on poverty, gender and unemployment and was born and raised in Dandora - said the aim was to shake people out of complacency. \u201cThere is a lot of imbalance in our communities. The quality of life they are living is not what it should be,\u201d the 33-year-old dreadlocked star said beside the heap of squalor. \u201cPeople here think this is a curse from God or because they are not working hard enough. They have become comfortable with the injustice. So we want to make them see it doesn\u2019t have to be like this, and their lives are supposed to be way better.\u201d Reporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

        "article": "Jan 22 (Reuters) - Thousands of federal workers faced anxiety about the status of their jobs and paychecks after U.S. Senate leaders failed to reach agreement to end a federal government shutdown before the work week begins on Monday. Funding for federal agencies ran out at midnight on Friday and was not renewed amid a dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats over immigration. Late on Sunday, the Senate scheduled a vote on a stopgap spending measure for noon on Monday (1700 GMT), ensuring the federal government would stay shut in the morning and leaving workers uncertain how long it would last. \u201cThis is incredibly stressful,\u201d said Jessica Klement, vice president at the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, which represents more than 20,000 workers. \u201cEssential employees must report to work without knowing when they\u2019ll be paid next. Non-essential employees will be forced to stay home without pay, not knowing if back pay will be provided,\u201d she said. Some employees may not have received notice of their status on Friday, she added, so they could be going into work on Monday morning only to be sent home again. During shutdowns, non-essential government employees are furloughed, or placed on temporary unpaid leave. Workers deemed essential, including those dealing with public safety and national security, keep working. The last shutdown, in October 2013, lasted more than two weeks and more than 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. There is no official tally of how many would be off work this time. But local economies could be hurt in communities where thousands of non-essential personnel are likely to be off work, from Norfolk, Virginia, and Fayetteville, North Carolina, to Lakewood, Washington, and Oceanside, California. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will continue to process applications for open enrollment, officials said, and the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled is expected to function largely without disruption. Pamela Gillis Gilbertz, a health communication worker for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told Reuters by phone on Sunday night that Congress had always paid workers retroactively - but that it was not guaranteed. Her agency is expected to keep providing what it calls \u201cminimal support\u201d during the shutdown, and has said it will keep responding to influenza outbreaks. Gilbertz, who was planning to log into her office computer system on Monday for further guidance, said shutdowns could disrupt workers\u2019 finances, even if they are eventually repaid. \u201cFor some people, it definitely will be a hardship, if you live paycheck to paycheck and you have bills that you need to pay,\u201d she said.

        "article": "(Reuters Health) - Although most Americans say they\u2019re willing to be an organ donor after they die, some people never sign up because they\u2019re unsure about what could happen to them in a medical emergency, according to a new study. In particular, survey respondents reported concerns about receiving adequate medical care if they registered to donate organs after they died. The medical community \u201c(needs) to address these misperceptions,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Marty Sellers, a transplant surgeon at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, in a phone interview.  In 2017, more than 10,000 deceased donors contributed to nearly 29,000 transplants in the U.S., according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Living donors contributed organs for an additional 6,000 transplants. But the supply is still far short of what\u2019s needed.  \u201cAbout 20 people die every day for lack of an organ donor,\u201d said Sellers, who is also associate medical director of LifeLink of Georgia, a nonprofit that coordinates organ and tissue donation. Sellers and colleagues at Emory surveyed 766 people from 37 states about their willingness to be an organ donor after they died, their willingness to donate a deceased family member\u2019s organs and any deterrents to signing up.  Nearly 85 percent of respondents were willing to donate organs after they died, which didn\u2019t differ much by age, gender, religion or location. Willingness to donate a family member\u2019s organs depended on whether families had talked about it before. For example, 95 percent of respondents said they\u2019d be willing to donate a family member\u2019s organs if the loved one had said \u201cyes\u201d during a discussion previously, and 61 percent would donate if no discussion had occurred.  At the same time, 12 percent of survey takers were wary about getting the right medical attention during a life-saving procedure at a hospital if there was potential for organs to be donated. In particular, 20 percent of African Americans voiced this concern. But transplant surgeons say health care teams caring for critically ill people are separate from the organ transplant teams.  Dr. Sander Florman, Director of the Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, told Reuters Health by email, \u201cThe doctors taking care of the patient are not the same people involved with the transplant team or the organ procurement organization.\u201d The transplant team \u201cis only called in when patients meet the criteria for brain death or unrecoverable injuries,\u201d Florman said. \u201cA \u2018virtual firewall\u2019 separates the care of the patient from the \u2018organ donor\u2019 consideration process,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Fishbein, Executive Director of the Medstar Georgetown Transplant Institute in Washington, DC, in an email.  Howard Nathan, president and CEO of the Gift of Life Donor Program in Philadelphia, told Reuters Health by phone, \u201cThe key is helping individuals make individual decisions and getting the myths out of the way. It\u2019s all about neighbors helping neighbors and sharing the positive stories we\u2019ve heard.\u201d Recently, he said, a woman visited the Gift of Life office to tell her husband\u2019s story of organ donation. He was a fireman who died in the line of duty; his organs were used to save five patients. \u201cShe told our staff it was one of the most important things she could do in honor of her husband who was always saving lives,\u201d Nathan said.

SPD delegates voted 362 to 279, with one abstention, to press ahead with negotiations. The center-left party\u2019s leaders had agreed a preliminary coalition blueprint with Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc earlier this month.  A recount was held after an initial show of hands was too close to call for the SPD official in charge of the count and the result was slightly narrower that most analysts expected. \u201cWe are of course all relieved,\u201d SPD leader Martin Schulz told Phoenix television after the vote in Bonn, the capital of former West Germany where late SPD chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt earned reputations as global statesmen. Now, the SPD aims to negotiate an improved coalition deal it can sell to members wary of acting as junior partner to Merkel. Schulz has already said that all SPD members will get to vote on a final coalition deal. \u201cThe coalition talks are going to be just as hard as the exploratory talks,\u201d said Schulz. \u201cWe will talk to conservatives in the coming days and agree on a time frame. Then I hope that we will start negotiations soon.\u201d Merkel welcomed the SPD\u2019s decision, saying she looked forward to intensive talks focused on reaching a conclusion which she hoped would take place in a sensible atmosphere.  \u201cThe blueprint from the exploratory talks is the framework in which we will negotiate and there are still many questions to clear up in detail and that will require intensive talks,\u201d Merkel told reporters. The beginning of full coalition negotiations is likely to be welcomed by Germany\u2019s partners in Europe, where Merkel has long played a leading role in economic and security affairs. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday they wanted to deepen bilateral cooperation and give the European Union a fresh push toward closer integration. The leader of Merkel\u2019s Bavarian allies, Horst Seehofer, told Bild am Sonntag before the SPD vote he expected a new government to be in place in the first half of March. After the vote, he said the close decision would not make the negotiations easy. The head of Germany\u2019s BDI industry association, Dieter Kempf, said the SPD vote was no reason to relax. \u201cThe vote sets new high hurdles for successful negotiations,\u201d Kempf said.

REUTERS/Wolfgang RattaySPD leaders vowed to improve on the coalition blueprint. \u201cWe will negotiate until the other side squeals,\u201d the party\u2019s parliamentary leader, Andrea Nahles, said in the most impassioned of the speeches at the congress in Bonn, imploring delegates to vote \u2018yes\u2019. In an interview with ZDF television, Schulz dodged the question of whether he would join a Merkel-led cabinet, by saying: \u201cPersonnel matters will for sure be discussed at the end.\u201d SPD demands include the abolition of Germany\u2019s dual public-private health insurance system in favor of a single citizen\u2019s insurance, scaling back temporary employment contracts and allowing family reunions for asylum seekers suffering unusual hardship. Slideshow (7 Images)After the vote, leading members of Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) immediately rejected SPD demands for concessions. \u201cThe benchmark for further negotiations is what we already agreed on during exploratory talks,\u201d Thomas Strobl, a CDU deputy party chairmen, told Funke media group. Volker Bouffier, CDU premier in the western state of Hesse, added: \u201cThe result of the exploratory talks counts. The key points may no longer be called into question.\u201d However, SPD party members will still get to vote on any final coalition deal that emerges. The coalition blueprint also includes a clause that provides for a review after two years of the next government\u2019s progress to assess whether any changes to its mission are needed. The SPD and conservative blocs, which both bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, struck their preliminary deal after exploratory talks on renewing their ruling alliance that took office in 2013.  SPD critics, including the party\u2019s youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, argued the exploratory blueprint did not bear enough of the SPD\u2019s hallmarks. Andrea Roemmele, professor for communication in politics at Hertie School of Governance, said the close result was difficult for Schulz, who led the party to its worst election result last September since Germany became a federal republic in 1949. \u201cBut it is also difficult for the conservatives because they know any deal still has to go through SPD members,\u201d Roemmele told Phoenix television.

        "article": "(Reuters Health) - - People with diabetes who live in poor communities with limited access to exercise facilities or grocery stores may have a harder time managing their symptoms than diabetics living in more affluent areas, a U.S. study suggests. Communities with lower employment, income and education that have scant resources to support exercise and healthy eating have long been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes. For the current study, however, researchers focused on 15,308 patients who already had diabetes to see if their neighborhoods might impact how well they lived with the disease.  At the start of the study, all of the patients had poorly controlled diabetes, based on blood tests that show the percentage of hemoglobin (a molecule on red blood cells) that is coated with sugar. So-called hemoglobin A1c levels reflect average blood sugar levels over about three months. Readings above 6.5 signal diabetes, and everyone in the study had readings of at least 7.5.  Over six months, reductions in A1c were 0.07 percent less in townships with the most socioeconomic deprivation than in the most affluent neighborhoods, the study found.  At the same time, A1c improvements were up to 0.19 percent greater in communities with the most exercise opportunities than in the places with the fewest resources for physical activity. A1c improvements were also 0.10 percent bigger in areas with the best food availability.  \u201cPeople with type 2 diabetes do not live in their doctors\u2019 offices, and most of the work they do to control their disease, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising, and taking their medications, happens in the communities in which they live,\u201d said lead study author Annemarie Hirsch of the Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania. \u201cIf communities do not offer healthy food options or safe places to exercise, it is going to be harder to manage type 2 diabetes,\u201d Hirsch said by email. \u201cLiving in neighborhoods with high unemployment and high poverty can also cause stress, and chronic stress has been associated with poorer (blood sugar) control in people with type 2 diabetes.\u201d Globally, almost one in 10 adults has diabetes, according to the World Health Organization. Most of them have what\u2019s known as type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity and aging.  Patients in the current study were 58 years old on average, and most of them were white. Their initial A1c readings averaged 8.2., dangerously elevated blood sugar that can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness, amputations and death.  The influence of neighborhoods on A1c was more pronounced in smaller townships, and less apparent or nonexistent in bigger cities, researchers report in Diabetes Care.  The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how communities might impact blood sugar in people with diabetes. Another limitation is all the patients were treated at Geisinger, a health system based in Pennsylvania, and the results might be different elsewhere.  \u201cIt might be that those with worse pre-existing disease or risk moved to this poorer neighborhood,\u201d said Dr. Rita Hamad, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  \u201cThat means the neighborhood isn\u2019t causing their worse diabetes; they already were at risk because of personal characteristics,\u201d Hamad said by email.  Still, the findings add to the evidence that it can be much harder for patients in poor neighborhoods with limited resources to manage diabetes and other chronic diseases, Hamad said.  Even in bad neighborhoods, people still have options for managing diabetes, added Daniel Lackland, a researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.  First off, people should not smoke, Lackland said by email. After that, they should make creative use of the resources that are available.  \u201cFor example, if the community is unsafe and there is not access to exercise facilities, walk at shopping malls, parks or public buildings,\u201d Lackland advised. \u201cAnd for food, read labels and select the healthiest options.\u201d SOURCE: bit.ly/2Debto0 Diabetes Care, online December 19, 2017.

        "article": "SEATTLE (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - If elected officials get their way, the entire West Coast of North America could be putting a price on pollution by the end of this year. As state legislature sessions opened this month, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee called for a carbon tax and Oregon legislators proposed a \u201ccap and invest\u201d system. Both policies are designed to make industrial emitters of carbon dioxide pay some of the costs of damage caused by growing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and to create incentives for them to reduce emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the major drivers of human-caused climate change. If the Washington and Oregon legislatures pass such measures, they would join California\u2019s cap-and-trade system to the south and British Columbia\u2019s carbon tax to the north. The jurisdictions would be part of a united Pacific front on climate change. \u201cIt is time to step up and give our citizens what they demand and deserve \u2014 and what is the law \u2014 which is a fight against climate change and the damaging health effects of carbon pollution,\u201d Inslee, a Democrat, said in his State of the State speech on January 9. CARBON CUTTING OPTIONS In Oregon, political observers see the 2018 legislative session as the best opportunity to create a so-called \u201ccap and invest\u201d system that would cap the amount of carbon that industrial polluters can emit, forcing them to buy allowances for any excess.  Early estimates suggest the plan could raise up to $1.8 billion annually that could in turn be invested in renewable energy, low-carbon transportation, and other climate-friendly measures.  Governor Kate Brown has been less vocal than Inslee about her state\u2019s carbon plan, whose details remain less developed than the Washington proposal. In 2016, Washington state voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have created the first carbon tax in the United States.  Environmental groups split on the measure, with some criticizing the fact that cash from the tax would used to lower other taxes, rather to invest in the needs of vulnerable communities most affected by climate change. But with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Washington state legislature, Inslee, who has made climate change a signature issue, has a good chance of seeing his landmark policy proposal come to life, experts say. Inslee has proposed a $20 per ton tax on industrial carbon emissions that would increase 3.5 percent annually above the rate of inflation in order to deter increased carbon emissions. The money raised would be reinvested in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts such as expanded public transportation, subsidized home insulation, and improving forest health.  The tax would increase consumer costs for heating oil, petrol, and electricity in areas not served by hydropower, which is a major energy source in Washington.  The governor\u2019s office estimates that by 2020, electricity prices could increase 4 percent per unit, natural gas 9 percent and gasoline 6 percent per gallon.  The governor\u2019s office said such price increases \u201care well within the range of normal price fluctuation for oil and gas, and normal rate increases for utilities\u201d. Inslee\u2019s office said the tax would raise $3.3 billion in its first four years.  \u201cWe are still reviewing the details, but, yes, we think the policy gets the big pieces right and we are broadly supporting it,\u201d Carbon Washington Executive Director Kyle Murphy told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The grassroots group led the signature drive to put the failed 2016 carbon tax initiative on the ballot. WHERE TO DIRECT THE CASH? Others grassroots climate groups are more cautious, however.  Front and Centered is a coalition of communities of color seeking climate justice. Many of the groups represented by Front and Centered opposed the carbon tax initiative that made it to the 2016 ballot because it did not reinvest the revenue raised by the tax in their communities. Instead, the tax money would have been offset by tax cuts, with only 10 percent of Washington residents receiving assistance to pay higher energy and fuel prices. \u201cWe support Governor Inslee\u2019s ongoing leadership, as well as the idea of taxing carbon and reinvesting revenue,\u201d Front and Centered spokesperson Aiko Schaefer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But \u201cwe would like to see the bill strengthened in terms of ensuring that communities that are highly impacted both have greater investment and have a voice in the process,\u201d she said. According to a 2016 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, over half of all Republicans and nearly 90 percent of Democrats in both Washington and Oregon states believe in global warming, which is above the U.S. national average. Both states voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 by wide margins and currently have entirely Democratic majorities in their state legislatures as well as Democratic governors. \u201cI believe we have to pay for our waste,\u201d said handyman Ed Dep, sitting at a caf\u00e9 in a Seattle co-operative grocery store. \u201cMitigating climate change is a cost we should be willing to pay.\u201d CANADA AND CALIFORNIA LESSONS As the details of carbon pricing enter the negotiation phase in the Washington and Oregon legislatures, lawmakers can look both north and south for lesson learned.  British Columbia\u2019s carbon tax of 30 Canadian dollars per ton, the continent\u2019s first when it was adopted in 2008, has reduced emissions by 5 to 15 percent while not hampering economic growth, according to a Duke University and University of Ottawa study.  California\u2019s cap-and-trade system, introduced in 2013, had a rocky start but has now sold out its pollution allowances for consecutive quarters, prompting critics to suggest it has been too successful as polluters buy up credits rather than aggressively reduce emissions. Inslee previously tried a cap-and-trade system such as the one Oregon is now pursuing, but abandoned it in favor of a carbon tax.  Environmentalists tend to prefer cap-and-trade because such systems fix the total amount of carbon emissions allowed and that amount can be lowered over time.  Business groups tend to prefer carbon taxes because the price of pollution is fixed, whereas prices for emissions can fluctuate in a cap-and-trade market system. Whatever the system of pricing carbon, climate justice activists say they want to make sure one principle is adhered to.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make people poorer in the process,\u201d Schaefer said.

        "article": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s cabinet is likely to announce an incentive scheme this month to boost investment in 20 projects ranging from healthcare to energy that are worth a total of 80 billion lira ($21 billion), economy minister Nihat Zeybekci told Reuters. The projects are chosen from seven sectors in which Turkey is highly dependent on imports, Zeybekci said in an interview, adding that imports are likely to fall by $6-7 billion annually when these projects are completed. \u201cWe needed to have a project-based incentive system to create our own \u2018giants\u2019 in sectors where we are in need of technology transfer and show a current account deficit,\u201d he said in an interview late on Friday.

        "article": "(Reuters Health) - - When state Medicaid programs increased physician payment rates, more pediatricians agreed to treat low-income kids covered by the health insurance program for the poor, a U.S. study suggests  Researchers examined the proportion of pediatricians accepting Medicaid before and after payments increased in 2013 and 2014 - and found gains in participation nationwide as well as in most studied states.  \u201cWhen many doctors refuse to accept Medicaid patients or place restrictions on patient access to care, it becomes harder for parents to find quality physicians for their children within a reasonable geographic area,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Andrew Racine, a researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System in Bronx, New York. \u201cPatient needs often go unmet and necessary care may be delayed, resulting in avoidable emergency room visits and hospital admissions,\u201d Racine said by email. \u201cThe long-term consequences include poorer outcomes for the patients and ultimately higher health care costs for the country.\u201d Before the payment increases, Medicaid fees for primary care services for all age groups were typically 59 percent of the amount paid by Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly, researchers note in Pediatrics.  An estimated 36 percent to 48 percent of U.S. children are insured by Medicaid, and kids make up 53 percent of Medicaid enrollees.  But Medicaid payment for pediatric primary care services averaged 64 percent of payment from Medicare and 53 percent of payment from private insurance before 2013, when Medicaid payments were raised as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  For the current study, researchers examined data from nationwide surveys of pediatricians done by the American Academy of Pediatrics that assessed how many doctors accepted Medicaid and what proportion of patients were insured by the program.  The proportion of pediatrics practices accepting at least some new Medicaid patients increased 3 percentage points to about 77 percent after the payment increases.  At the same time, the proportion of practices accepting all new Medicaid patients increased almost 6 percentage points to about 43 percent. And the proportion of doctors taking at least as many Medicaid as privately insured patients climbed almost 6 percentage points to about 56 percent. Plus, the proportion of pediatricians not accepting any Medicaid patients dropped 2 percentage points to less than 15 percent.  One limitation of the study is that it relied on physicians to accurately recall and report the proportion of Medicaid patients they accepted, the authors note. The study also focused on pediatricians in private practice, not at community clinics or safety net facilities.  Even so, the results offer fresh evidence that payment increases can work as intended, particularly in getting physicans who accept Medicaid to take on more patients with this type of coverage, said Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. \u201cThat\u2019s important, because even if new providers didn\u2019t sign up because the increase was only for two years, others who were already participating increased and/or maintained their level of participation, which is important for access,\u201d Solomon, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.  \u201cIt suggests that increasing payment rates increases participation defined broadly to include the degree of participation of providers already taking patients,\u201d Solomon added. \u201cHaving the participation of a broad array of doctors including those in private practice is important so kids can get care when they need it and that they can have an ongoing relationship with a pediatrician.\u201d The study also suggests that any reduction in payments associated with proposed cuts to the Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which operates in tandem with Medicaid in most states, could mean less access to care, said Brendan Saloner, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.  \u201cIf CHIP funding runs out - and that seems to be what is happening as of this month in many states - that will lead children to be dropped from the program and will cause many pediatricians to rethink whether to participate in CHIP, since they will not have assurance that the bills will continue to get paid,\u201d Saloner, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.

        "article": "ISRAEL-GAZA BORDER (Reuters) - The worst fighting on the Gaza Strip front since 2014 is being  calibrated by Hamas, which wants to signal defiance of Israel and the United States while being careful not to trigger a new war for the enclave\u2019s penned-in Palestinians. Since President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, Palestinians in Gaza have launched 18 cross-border rockets or mortars - a third of all such attacks in 3-1/2 years of relative quiet. For Israel\u2019s part, though residents in the south have raised a clamour for harsh retaliation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has counselled caution and targeted mostly unmanned Hamas facilities in night-time airstrikes. The careful moves reflect the balancing act maintained both by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, and the Israeli government, old foes who share a reluctance to go to war again. Gaza\u2019s neighbourhoods still bear the scars of the destruction caused by Israeli attacks during a seven-week conflict in 2014. In Israel, there is little eagerness to endure the daily sirens warning of rocket strikes. But ordinary Israelis and Palestinians are keenly aware that even a single incident - a rocket causing multiple fatalities in Israel or Israeli forces killing a militant leader - could set off a conflagration that would be beyond their leaders\u2019 control. Two Hamas gunmen have died in retaliatory Israeli air strikes and 15 protesters from Israeli gunfire. \u201cThe recent weeks of rockets and Israeli bombardment proved an explosion is possible,\u201d said Gaza political analyst Akram Attalla. \u201cHow long will Hamas continue to take Israeli strikes to its positions without a response? And how long will Israel\u2019s Netanyahu tolerate internal criticism? There is no guarantee.\u201d  While there have been no Israeli fatalities or serious injuries in the rocket strikes, farmers in communities close to the Gazan border think twice about tilling fields where they might be exposed and children practice duck-and-cover drills should air raid sirens sound. \u201cLately we do feel that there is more presence of the army. We have been told to be more careful, to clear the bomb shelter just in case. You never know when the next rocket will come,\u201d said Hila Fenlon, resident of the farm collective Nativ Haasara.  Hamas has responded to Trump\u2019s move by mobilising mass protests at the border and turning a blind eye to other factions firing into Israel in two weeks of daily attacks, which have tailed off recently.  \u201cThis saves face for Hamas, as it appears to be the one that stands behind these protests without the need to go to war,\u201d said Attalla. A more violent response was tamped down in debate among Palestinian factions who agreed that an armed confrontation could erode the international support Palestinians have won diplomatically and shift attention from the political process. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said no-one should underestimate the potential for hostilities to resume under what he called an Israeli occupation, however. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but remains the conduit for the passage of goods and supplies most of its electricity. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, maintain tight restrictions on the passage of Palestinians through their borders with the enclave.\u00a0 An Israeli soldier stands near a military jeep next to the border fence with the southern Gaza Strip, in Nir Oz, Israel January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen\u201cThe situation in Gaza is very difficult and is not tolerable and is doomed to explode,\u201d he told Reuters. IRANIAN SUPPORT Israel sees an outside catalyst for the violence - Iran, which both Hamas and its sometime ally Islamic Jihad say has pledged unlimited assistance for them as the Syrian civil war, where Tehran deployed reinforcements for Damascus, winds down.  Israel has gone out its way to blame Islamic Jihad and other groups for the rocket and mortar attacks, rather than Hamas, and even gave grudging credit to Hamas for being mindful of Palestinian civilian needs. \u201cCalls to respond with full force against Hamas are irresponsible,\u201d the top Israeli general, Gadi Eizenkot, said in a speech last week. He noted Gaza\u2019s \u201cdanger of humanitarian collapse\u201d, which, he said, had forced Hamas to engage with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and secured a renewed power supply to the enclave. Slideshow (4 Images)Israel also has problems elsewhere.  Having neutralised much of the rocket threat from Gaza with their Iron Dome interceptor system, and hard at a work on an underground wall that would block guerrilla tunnels from the territory, Israeli defence officials say they worry more about Iran and the combustible northern front with Syria and Lebanon. They also fear that the $1.1 billion sensor-equipped barrier on the 60-km (37-mile) frontier could tempt Gaza militants to use their tunnels to strike Israel before they lose them.  A range of economic initiatives have been broached, from the construction of an island off Gaza to handle direct imports by sea to the issuing of more permits for Palestinian labourers or agricultural exports to enter Israel.  \u201cThere is an effort to help the (Palestinian) population in a way that will not go to the armed wing of Hamas,\u201d said Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and head of Tel Aviv University\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies, which has prepared a 180-page memorandum on the Gaza crisis. Israeli concern about worsening Gaza\u2019s internal problems has put it at odds even with the Trump administration, which has threatened to cut U.S. contributions to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides essential aid for Palestinian refugees in the enclave, supporting and administering hundreds of schools and dozens of health facilities. Israel says funds should be cut gradually and UNRWA should ultimately be dismantled and its responsibilities transferred to the United Nations\u2019 global refugee agency.\u00a0 Cutting aid to UNRWA would spell \u201chuge pressures on Gaza\u2019s residents,\u201d said Saleh Naami, another Palestinian political analyst. Peter Lerner, a former Israeli military spokesman, agreed. \u201cWhile UNRWA is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment, and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all alternatives are worse for Israel,\u201d he said.

        "article": "BONN, Germany (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Arnold Schwarzenegger, former California governor and Hollywood actor and film producer, issued a challenge on Sunday to governments to start labeling fossil fuels with a public health warning that their use could cause illness and death. He lauded the World Health Organization (WHO) for sealing a 164-nation tobacco control pact in 2003 that led to consumers of cigarettes and cigars being alerted to the health risks of smoking, including lung cancer.  A similar accord could be put in place for products derived from fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which emit planet-warming gases when burned, said the politician and environmental activist. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great now if they could... make the same pact with the rest of the world to go and say, \u2018Let\u2019s label another thing that is killing you - which is fossil fuels,'\u201d he said to applause on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Bonn. Schwarzenegger suggested telling customers at petrol stations that \u201cwhat you pump into your tank may kill you\u201d, and plastering oil tankers driving along highways with messages that their contents are dangerous to health. \u201cHere\u2019s a challenge for you guys,\u201d he said, directly addressing WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who spoke at the same event. Schwarzenegger lamented that environmental pollution - estimated to kill more than 9 million people per year in all its forms - was rarely discussed at conferences on climate change. About two-thirds of those deaths are from air pollution. \u201cThis is a massive tragedy - and as depressing and terrifying as it is, we are not talking about it enough,\u201d he said. In his own political career, his campaign team found that talking about polar bears or degrees of temperature rise was not an effective way to communicate the threat of climate change to the public. But running adverts saying that air pollution killed and gave children breathing problems worked, he said.  Over the 12 days of the climate change conference in Germany, presided over by Fiji, more than 300,000 people would die from harmful substances in their environment, he noted. SMALL ISLANDS SUFFER Patricia Espinosa, head of the U.N. climate change secretariat, said climate change needed to be addressed from a broader view \u201cthat directly connects human health with the health of the planet\u201d.  Besides deaths caused by respiratory diseases from burning fossil fuels, global warming is harming coral reefs and fish supplies, causing hunger and poverty. Elsewhere, higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are reducing the nutritional content of crops, putting hundreds of millions of people at risk from vitamin deficiencies, she said. Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama underscored the damage done to health facilities in his small island state from extreme weather, including powerful Cyclone Winston, which caused 44 deaths and wiped out over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP last year. He stressed the importance of investing in infrastructure to make health systems stronger and more agile in the face of growing disaster threats as global warming brings wilder weather and rising seas.  Although the 2016 cyclone damaged health facilities, Fiji is now building new hospitals and clinics, and reinforcing existing ones, he said. But to do this requires funding, he added, noting that only a tiny fraction of climate finance is allocated for measures to protect health, and small island developing states \u201cwill see only a small part of that\u201d. An initiative launched on Sunday by the WHO, the U.N. climate secretariat and Fiji aims to triple international financial support for action on climate-related health issues in small island developing states. Its main goal is to ensure health systems are resilient to climate change by 2030. \u201cClimate change is not a political argument in Fiji and other island nations - it\u2019s everyday reality,\u201d whether that\u2019s in the form of destructive storms, rising sea levels or increased risk of infectious disease, said Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief. \u201cThese communities need assistance to cope with a world that is changing in front of them,\u201d he said.

        "article": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to help young \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants struggled to gain footing in the U.S. Congress on Monday, as lawmakers prepared to hold a Tuesday vote on a short-term government funding measure to avoid a rerun of January\u2019s three-day partial shutdown. Republicans in the House of Representatives were told at a Monday night meeting that the stop-gap measure would extend funding through March 23, along with a year of defense funding and two years of funding for community health centers, lawmakers said. Congress\u2019 failure to reach an immigration deal delayed passage of a temporary spending bill in mid-January, triggering the three-day shutdown. With existing money running out on Thursday, lawmakers were rushing to pass a stop-gap spending bill that would keep agencies open as they continue a months-long effort to give permanent protections to Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the United States when they were children.   Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier on Monday floated the idea of passing a big increase in defense appropriations through Sept. 30 while negotiations continued on non-defense spending levels - an idea Democrats have opposed. Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the House passes a short-term funding measure with long-term defense funding and sends it to the Senate, where it must pick up some Democratic support to pass, it \u201cwould be barreling head-first into a dead-end.\u201d House Republicans said they knew that if they passed such a bill on Tuesday it could be sent back by the Senate with additional defense funding stripped out. \u201cIf that\u2019s the choice they make then certainly we\u2019ll have to deal with it on Wednesday or Thursday if the bill comes back,\u201d Republican Representative Mark Meadows, head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters. Bipartisan momentum for an immigration bill got a boost earlier on Monday when Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Chris Coons introduced a compromise measure. Similar legislation has already gained some traction in the House of Representatives. But Republican President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss it immediately, saying any deal should provide funding for his long-promised Mexican border wall. The legislation did win the backing of a Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, who has been central to the fight for Dreamers. A broader bill by Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham was rejected by the White House last month. Besides protecting Dreamers from deportation, the McCain-Coons plan would boost security on the Mexican border. But it is narrower in scope than a plan Trump put forward last month, which was resisted by hardline Republicans and Democrats. It does not offer a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system or include funding for the wall, but calls for a way for Dreamers to avoid deportation and earn citizenship, while also bolstering border security. The legislation would rely on a variety of tools, not just a physical wall, for securing the southern U.S. border. The U.S. Capitol stands in Washington, DC, U.S. January 31, 2018.      REUTERS/Joshua RobertsAbout 700,000 Dreamers stand to lose temporary protections that have allowed them to work and study in the United States without fear of deportation under Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. The latest initiative would protect the 700,000, while also allowing hundreds of thousands of additional young immigrants in similar situations to apply for temporary legal status that could lead to U.S. citizenship. Most came from Mexico and Central American countries.  BROAD SUPPORT FOR DREAMERS FILE PHOTO: Protesters march in support of a permanent legislative solution for immigrants in Los Angeles, California, U.S. February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Monica Almeida\u201cThe bill ... does address the two most pressing problems we face: protecting DACA recipients and securing the border,\u201d Coons said in a statement with McCain. DACA had been set to expire on March 5 after Trump canceled the program last autumn and asked Congress to come up with a legislative solution by that date. A federal court last month blocked the Trump administration from ending the program, and the administration\u2019s appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.   Lawmakers have been struggling to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers. The last major legislative push failed in 2013-14 when House Republicans refused to consider a broad, bipartisan measure passed by the Senate. Related CoverageKey U.S. Senate Democrat throws weight behind new immigration billDuring a conference call with reporters, Coons said he was alarmed to hear some senators now talking about simply putting off long-term decisions about Dreamers for a year and making some \u201cmodest investments\u201d in additional border security. Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversees immigration policy along with other panels, also said that despite Trump\u2019s insistence on building a wall, border law enforcement officials in a recent briefing for senators did not make such a request. \u201cIt was clear they are not embracing the notion of a single concrete wall from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific\u201d Ocean, Coons said. Instead, he said administration officials spoke of the need to repair and upgrade existing fencing, build additional barriers and make other improvements. Trump has said any immigration deal must include billions of dollars to build the border wall. During his campaign, Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall, something the Mexican government has said it will not do. \u201cAny deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!\u201d the president said in a tweet on Monday.
